# Simon Says Game
This project is a web-based implementation of the Simon Says memory game, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this game, players must replicate a series of colors that are flashed on the screen. The sequence becomes progressively longer, and players must memorize and repeat the sequence accurately to level up.

## Features
- Interactive game with flashing colored buttons
- Audio effects for button presses and errors
- Dynamic level progression based on player performance
- Keeps track of the highest score

## How to Play
1. Press any key (except non-printable keys) to start the game.
2. The game will display a sequence of colors, which will flash on the screen.
3. Repeat the sequence by clicking the corresponding color buttons (Red, Yellow, Green, Blue).
4. If you repeat the sequence correctly, the game will move to the next level with a longer sequence.
5. If you make a mistake, the game ends, and your score will be displayed.
6. The highest score is saved and displayed at the top of the screen.

## Game Rules
1. **Starting the Game**: The game begins when the player presses any key. A sequence of colors will be flashed, and the player must replicate it by clicking the colored buttons.
2. **Sequence Progression**: Each time the player successfully completes the sequence, a new color is added to the sequence, and you have to memorise the sequence. After your correct 
 current level input the level increases.
3. **Making Mistakes**: If the player clicks the wrong color or gets the sequence wrong, the game will end, and the player's score will be displayed. The highest score is saved.
4. **Game Over**: After a mistake, the player is given an option to restart the game by pressing any key again.
